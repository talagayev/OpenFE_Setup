**OpenFE Setup** will allow you to prepare the files needed to perform a **OpenFE** simulation.

### Usage

Start **OpenFE Setup** by executing the command:

    openfe_setup

The **OpenFE Setup** interface is displayed through a web browser, but it is still
a single-user desktop application, not a web application. It should
automatically open a web browser displaying the user interface. If that does not happen for any reason, open a browser and point it to
the address displayed in the console window (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5000).
